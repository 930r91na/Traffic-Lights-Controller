This cruise includes traffic lights for cars, bikes and pedestrians. The planted problem was simple, but the solution required a lot of analysis and understanding of the relation between the cars, bikes and pedestrians, so that there would be a good flow in the intersection and no accidents. 

The objectives of the design were to control the lights and make a regressive counter for the pedestrians so that they would notice how much time left they have as they cross the street.
